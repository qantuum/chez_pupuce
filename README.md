*25-Jul-2018::Creating Employe, Fournisseur and Client databases, creating CRUD interface, Personnes, Clients, Employes, Fournisseurs Class  
*26-Jul-2018::First features in Clients class, including the dataRead method, some changes to be made  
*27-Jul-2018::First big bug, adding Produit, Fournisseur, FournisseurProduit, Commande databases, finding a way to use session_start and session_end to connnect/disconnect Client  
*30-Jul-2018::Last fixes to Clients with changing a bit method expressions and arguments :: course about sessions  
*31-Jul-2018::Starting all Employes methods, heavy copy/pasting session then changing all the necessary fields :: course about associating class/instances to database operations  
*01-Aug-2018::Continued Employes methods. A second bug is fixed, the bug was happening because of wrong table call. FrontEnd, form to connect an Employe by his nÂ° secu (not hashed). Hopefully adding boards to manage Fournisseurs and Produits  
*02-Aug-2018::Starting Fournisseurs methods. All methods are written in the same fashion; than in Clients and Employes. Adding method 'dataReadAll' to retrieve the entire table.

please add database in localhost  
database 'chez_pupuce.sql' included in root repository  
database user credentials have to be changed in the file './includes/credentials.php'   

features :  

>>> Client (user) has an interface to create an account, connect account session, disconnect account session, delete their account, and update their account  
**TODO on this** --- the Client must be able to see his Panier and also a selection of Produits. A front-end interface is there already, but it's not functional.  

>>> Employe (user) has an interface to create an account, connect account session, disconnect account session, delete their account. The Employes can not update their account. The Employes have global access to information about all the Produits and Fournisseurs stored in the database.  
**TODO on this** --- the Employe must be able to visualize and manage Fournisseur and Produits list. The Employes Update form has not been implemented (to keep time to go on different targets), but the update method is available. As time runs, the create, update, delete forms for Produits and Fournisseurs will NOT be implemented. Though the methods exist in the Classes.  

>>> **security** : no focus was made on security, since the exercise consists more in creating and managing databases, using OOP. Some simple tests are performed for checking stuff (i.e e-mail address can appear only once in db, postal code must be 5 characters long, passwd1 and passwd2 must be the same). The **TODOS on this** would consist on adding a pregmatch for every field in PHP, as well as building security blocks with the available tools in JS and HTML (warning on client-side if a form error appears). Nevertheless, the use of the Medoo framework is a sure way to avoid SQL injections, since Medoo uses an API to give instructions to SQL.  

frameworks :  

* Medoo (database management in PHP)  
* Bootstrap (frontEnd design)  
* jQuery (unused)  
* dataTables (failed to use)
